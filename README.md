# Different-Tasks-in-Computer-Vision
Overview
This repository implements a comprehensive pipeline for various computer vision tasks:

Object Detection: Identifies objects in images and videos using YOLOv8.
Object Segmentation: Segments objects at the pixel level.
Pose Estimation: Estimates human body poses through keypoint detection.
Object Classification: Categorizes detected objects into predefined classes.
Object Tracking: Tracks multiple objects using advanced algorithms like ByteTrack and BoT-SORT.
Car Speed Estimation: Calculates the speed of cars in video sequences.
Custom Dataset Support: Trains and applies YOLOv8 for object detection and tracking on custom datasets.
Key Components
Object Detection: The YOLOv8 model is used to perform fast and accurate object detection.
Segmentation: Provides pixel-level segmentation for each object detected.
Pose Estimation: Allows for keypoint detection and pose estimation.
Object Tracking: Integrates ByteTrack and BoT-SORT for tracking detected objects across video frames.
Speed Estimation: Calculates the speed of moving vehicles in video sequences.
Custom Dataset: Supports training YOLOv8 on custom datasets, enabling detection and tracking of user-defined objects.
